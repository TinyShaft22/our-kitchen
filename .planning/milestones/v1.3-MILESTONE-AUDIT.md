# v1.3 Broma Bakery Import — Milestone Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-01-19 (final)
**Status:** PASSED
**Overall Score:** 5/5 requirements satisfied

## Milestone Definition

**Original Goal (from ROADMAP.md):**
> Scrape 91 recipes from Broma Bakery (Cookies, Bars, Muffins, Brownies) and import via JSON into the food app with proper markdown formatting.

**Expanded Scope (Phase 22):**
> Upload images from Broma Bakery to imported recipes

**Phase 22.1 Addition:**
> Add ability to paste external image URLs as recipe photos

**Actual Outcome:**
- 105 recipes imported (exceeded original 91 target)
- 105/105 recipes have images (100% coverage)
- Paste URL feature complete

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| Scrape 91+ Broma recipes | SATISFIED | 105 recipes scraped (27 cookies, 36 bars, 21 muffins, 21 brownies) |
| Generate import-ready JSON | SATISFIED | 4 JSON files created with correct format |
| Import recipes via Settings | SATISFIED | All 105 imported, verified in browser |
| Folder structure (Broma > subcategories) | SATISFIED | Alphabetical: Bars, Brownies, Cookies, Muffins |
| Recipe images for all categories | SATISFIED | All 105 recipes have images |

**Score:** 5/5 requirements fully satisfied

## Image Storage Details

Images were added via two methods:

| Category | Recipes | Method | Storage |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|
| Cookies | 27 | Manual upload | Firebase Storage |
| Bars | 36 | Manual upload | Firebase Storage |
| Muffins | 21 | Script (update-recipe-images.mjs) | External URLs (bromabakery.com) |
| Brownies | 21 | Script (update-recipe-images.mjs) | External URLs (bromabakery.com) |
| **Total** | **105** | - | **100% coverage** |

Both storage types work identically - `MealCard.tsx` renders `<img src={meal.imageUrl}>` regardless of URL origin.

## Phase Completion

| Phase | Plans | Status | Verification |
|-------|-------|--------|--------------|
| 16. Scraping Infrastructure | 2/2 | Complete | SUMMARY.md confirms |

## Cross-Phase Integration

| From | To | Via | Status |
|------|-----|-----|--------|
| Phase 16 INGREDIENT-MAP | Phases 17-20 | Category mapping | CONNECTED |
| Phase 17 cookies-import.json | Phase 21 Import | JSON format | CONNECTED |
| Phase 18 bars-import.json | Phase 21 Import | JSON format | CONNECTED |
| Phase 19 muffins-import.json | Phase 21 Import | JSON format | CONNECTED |
| Phase 19 muffins-images.json | Phase 22 Script | Flat array format | CONNECTED |
| Phase 20 brownies-import.json | Phase 21 Import | JSON format | CONNECTED |
| Phase 20 brownies-images.json | Phase 22 Script | Flat array format | CONNECTED |
| Manual upload (cookies/bars) | Firestore imageUrl | Firebase Storage | CONNECTED |

**Score:** 10/10 connections working

## E2E Flow Status

| Flow | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Recipe import (JSON → App) | COMPLETE | 105 recipes imported and display correctly |
| Folder navigation | COMPLETE | Broma > 4 subfolders, alphabetical order |
| Markdown rendering | COMPLETE | Instructions render with headers, lists, links |
| Image display | COMPLETE | All 105 recipes have images (mixed storage) |
| Paste URL | COMPLETE | Add/Edit modals support external URLs |

**Score:** 5/5 flows complete

## Tech Debt (Non-blocking)

1. **Mixed image storage:** Cookies/bars use Firebase Storage, muffins/brownies use external URLs
   - Impact: None functional; minor consistency concern
   - Recommendation: Document as acceptable variation

2. **Unused image JSON files:** cookies-images.json exists but wasn't used (manual upload chosen instead)
   - Impact: None; file can remain for reference
   - Recommendation: No action needed

## Summary

v1.3 Broma Bakery Import milestone is **COMPLETE**:

- **105 recipes** imported (exceeded 91 target)
- **100% image coverage** (63 via manual upload, 42 via script)
- **Folder organization** working (Broma > Bars, Brownies, Cookies, Muffins)
- **Markdown rendering** working (instructions display properly)
- **Paste URL feature** added (Phase 22.1)

Ready to proceed to v2.0 Alexa Integration.
