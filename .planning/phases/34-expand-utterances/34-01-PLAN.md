<objective>
Expand sample utterances for all custom intents to 10+ samples each, improving Name-Free Interaction (NFI) training effectiveness.

Purpose: Better utterance variety helps Alexa route natural language commands to our skill without explicit invocation. NFI requires diverse training data to compete with Amazon's built-in intents (shopping list, meal planning).

Output: Updated en-US.json with 10+ utterances per custom intent, using natural conversational patterns and mixed tones.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Expand meal and recipe intent utterances</name>
  <files>our-kitchen-alexa/skill-package/interactionModels/custom/en-US.json</files>
  <action>
Add utterances to reach 10+ samples for these intents:

**BrowseMealsIntent** (currently 8, need 2+):
Add natural NFI-friendly phrases:
- "what are we having for dinner"
- "show me the meal plan for this week"
- "what meals do we have planned"
- "what's for dinner tonight"
- "dinner plans"
- "show me what's planned"

**BrowseCategoryIntent** (currently 7, need 3+):
Add variety with {Category} slot:
- "show {Category}"
- "what {Category} recipes are there"
- "I'm looking for {Category}"
- "give me {Category} options"
- "let's see {Category}"

**GetRecipeIntent** (currently 7, need 3+):
Add natural phrasing with {MealName} slot:
- "give me the {MealName} recipe"
- "pull up {MealName}"
- "I need the recipe for {MealName}"
- "what goes into {MealName}"
- "show {MealName} ingredients"

**StartCookingIntent** (currently 9, need 1+):
Add natural cooking mode triggers with {MealName} slot:
- "let's get cooking {MealName}"
- "help me cook {MealName}"
- "cooking mode for {MealName}"
- "step by step {MealName}"
- "walk me through making {MealName}"

Guidelines:
- Include contractions naturally (what's, let's, I'm)
- Mix tones: casual ("dinner plans"), direct ("show meals"), polite ("I'm looking for")
- Ensure slot values appear in varied positions
- Avoid robotic phrasing like "please execute meal display command"
  </action>

Count samples in en-US.json:

- BrowseCategoryIntent: 10+ samples
- GetRecipeIntent: 10+ samples
- StartCookingIntent: 10+ samples

  <done>All four meal/recipe intents have 10+ diverse utterance samples</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Expand grocery and household intent utterances</name>
  <files>our-kitchen-alexa/skill-package/interactionModels/custom/en-US.json</files>
  <action>
Add utterances to reach 10+ samples for these intents:

**ReadGroceryListIntent** (currently 12, already good but add variety):
Add more natural phrasing with optional {StoreName} slot:
- "what's left on the grocery list"
- "read back the list"
- "what haven't we bought yet"
- "grocery list please"
- "what else do we need"

**AddGroceryIntent** (currently 9, need 1+):
IMPORTANT: Use "to the list" patterns - users rarely say bare "add X"
- "put {GroceryItem} on my list"
- "I need to get {GroceryItem}"
- "we're out of {GroceryItem}"
- "add {GroceryItem} to my shopping list"
- "we need to buy {GroceryItem}"
- "don't forget {GroceryItem}"
- "remember to get {GroceryItem}"
- "put down {GroceryItem}"
- "I need {Quantity} {GroceryItem}"
- "get me {Quantity} {GroceryItem}"

**UndoGroceryIntent** (currently 6, need 4+):
Add conversational undo phrases:
- "scratch that"
- "wait no"
- "I didn't mean that"
- "take it back"
- "oops undo"
- "that was wrong"
- "go back"

**RemoveGroceryIntent** (currently 5, need 5+):
Add natural removal phrasing with {GroceryItem} slot:
- "scratch {GroceryItem} off the list"
- "we don't need {GroceryItem} anymore"
- "take {GroceryItem} off"
- "forget {GroceryItem}"
- "cross off {GroceryItem}"
- "never mind {GroceryItem}"
- "I don't need {GroceryItem}"

**CheckOffGroceryIntent** (currently 6, need 4+):
Add shopping completion phrases with {GroceryItem} slot:
- "got the {GroceryItem}"
- "grabbed {GroceryItem}"
- "I have the {GroceryItem}"
- "we got {GroceryItem}"
- "{GroceryItem} done"
- "found {GroceryItem}"
- "crossed off {GroceryItem}"

**LinkHouseholdIntent** (currently 7, need 3+):
Add PIN entry variations with {PinCode} slot:
- "the code is {PinCode}"
- "enter {PinCode}"
- "pin is {PinCode}"
- "link with {PinCode}"
- "set up household {PinCode}"
- "my household code is {PinCode}"

Guidelines:
- "to the list" / "on my list" patterns are PRIORITY for AddGroceryIntent
- Casual contractions: "we're", "don't", "didn't"
- Past tense for CheckOff: "grabbed", "found", "got"
- Keep undo phrases short and reflexive

Run JSON validation:
```bash
cd our-kitchen-alexa
cat skill-package/interactionModels/custom/en-US.json | python3 -m json.tool > /dev/null && echo "Valid JSON"
```

Count all custom intent samples:
```bash
grep -E '"samples": \[' -A 50 our-kitchen-alexa/skill-package/interactionModels/custom/en-US.json | grep -E '^\s+"[^"]+"' | wc -l
```

Verify minimum 10 per intent by visual inspection of the samples arrays.
