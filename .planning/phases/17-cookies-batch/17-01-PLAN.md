**Established patterns from Phase 16:**
- WebSearch to find valid recipe URLs first (avoid 404s)
- WebFetch to extract recipe content
- Ingredient mapping using INGREDIENT-MAP.md reference
- JSON format: version 1, meals array with isBaking:true, subcategory:"Broma/Cookies"

**Target source:**
- Broma Bakery cookies category: https://bromabakery.com/category/recipes/cookies/
- Expected: 27 recipes

**Recipe format to extract:**
- Title
- Yield (servings/cookies)
- Prep/Cook/Chill times
- Ingredients with quantities
- Instructions (numbered steps)
- Original URL for attribution
