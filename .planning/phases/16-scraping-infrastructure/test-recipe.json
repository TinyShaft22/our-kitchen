      "instructions": "## The BEST Chocolate Chip Cookies\n\n**Yield:** 15 cookies  \n**Prep:** 20 min | **Chill:** 1 hour | **Bake:** 12-13 min\n\n### Ingredients\n- 3/4 cup (168g) unsalted butter\n- 1 cup (212g) packed light brown sugar\n- 1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar\n- 1 large egg + 1 large egg yolk, room temperature\n- 1 tbsp pure vanilla extract\n- 1 3/4 cup (220g) all-purpose flour\n- 3/4 tsp baking soda\n- 3/4 tsp kosher salt (plus flaky sea salt for topping)\n- 1 1/4 cups (210g) semisweet or bittersweet chocolate chips\n\n### Instructions\n\n1. **Brown the butter:** In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stir every 10-15 seconds until golden with brown bits visible (5-7 minutes). Cool for approximately 5 minutes.\n\n2. **Mix wet ingredients:** Combine browned butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar in a large bowl. Add egg, egg yolk, and vanilla; mix well.\n\n3. **Add dry ingredients:** Fold in flour, baking soda, and salt until no streaks remain. Avoid overmixing.\n\n4. **Add chocolate:** Fold in chocolate chips until distributed. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or overnight).\n\n5. **Prep for baking:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Allow dough to soften at room temperature for about 20 minutes. Scoop using a 1 1/2 ounce cookie scoop, spacing 2 inches apart.\n\n6. **Bake:** 12-13 minutes until edges are light golden but centers remain soft. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt and cool slightly on the sheet.\n\n### Notes\nThe dough should be soft but not sticky. Remove cookies while centers appear underdone - they continue baking as they cool for optimal texture.\n\n---\n[Original recipe from Broma Bakery](https://bromabakery.com/best-chocolate-chip-cookies/)",
