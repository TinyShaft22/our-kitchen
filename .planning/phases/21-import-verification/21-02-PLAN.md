--- POWERSHELL HANDOFF ---
Run this in PowerShell (not WSL):
1. Open browser to http://localhost:5173 (ensure dev server running)
2. Log into household 0428
3. Go to Baking section

**Verify folder structure:**
1. Click on Broma folder - should expand to show 4 subfolders
2. Verify these subfolders exist:
   - Cookies (should show 27 recipes)
   - Bars (should show 36 recipes)
   - Muffins (should show 21 recipes)
   - Brownies (should show 21 recipes)

**Verify recipe counts:**
Total should be 105 recipes under Broma.

When done, return to WSL and report:
- Folder structure correct? (yes/no)
- Recipe counts per folder
- Any missing folders or recipes

Continue from previous session:

**Test 3 recipes (one from each new category):**

1. Open a muffin recipe (e.g., "Fluffy Chocolate Chip Muffins")
   - Click to expand/view details
   - Check: Instructions show with headers, numbered steps, bullet points
   - Check: Original recipe link is clickable
   - Check: Ingredient list displays correctly

2. Open a brownie recipe (e.g., "Brown Butter Brownies")
   - Same checks as above

3. Open one cookie and one bar recipe for comparison
   - Verify consistent formatting across all categories

**Verify markdown rendering:**
- Headers (## Recipe Name) render as headings
- Numbered lists (1. 2. 3.) render as ordered lists
- Links [text](url) are clickable
- No raw markdown symbols visible

When done, return to WSL and report:
- Markdown renders correctly? (yes/no)
- Instructions readable? (yes/no)
- Any rendering issues found? (describe)

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Document verification results</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/21-import-verification/21-02-SUMMARY.md</files>
  <action>
Based on user verification feedback from Tasks 1 and 2, create the summary document.

If all verifications passed:
- Document successful import of 105 recipes
- Note folder structure is correct
- Confirm markdown rendering works
- Phase 21 complete, ready for Phase 22 (image upload)

If issues were found:
- Document each issue with description
- Assess severity (critical vs minor)
- Per CONTEXT.md decisions: Log minor issues, don't block phase
- Critical issues would need immediate fix (but likely none expected)
  </action>
  <verify>Summary file exists with verification results documented</verify>
  <done>Verification results captured in summary, phase status determined</done>
</task>
