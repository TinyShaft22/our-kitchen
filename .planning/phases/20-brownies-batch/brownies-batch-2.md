3. Once melted, add both sugars, milk, coffee, vanilla extract, and eggs into the chocolate mixture, stirring until combined (make sure your chocolate mixture has cooled slightly as to not cook the eggs! If your chocolate mixture is very hot, you can stir in everything except for the eggs first to help cool it down, then add the eggs second).

5. Pour into lined baking pan and cook for approximately 30 minutes. If using sea salt, sprinkle over brownies once removed from oven. Allow to cool for 10 minutes before cutting.
