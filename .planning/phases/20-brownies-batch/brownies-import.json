The sugar will become lumpy before melting into a brownish color.\n\n2. Add butter - Once fully melted and dark amber, remove from heat immediately and stir in butter. The mixture will bubble vigorously.\n\n3. Combine - Stir butter and sugar together for 1-2 minutes until completely combined.\n\n4. Add cream and salt - Pour in heavy cream and sea salt (use 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons based on preference). Stir until combined, then return to stove for about 30 seconds while stirring. Remove from heat and cool for 15 minutes.\n\n**Make the Brownies:**\n\n5. Preheat and prep - Preheat oven to 350°F. Generously grease a large skillet with butter.\n\n6. Make batter - Melt butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Stir in sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, and salt. Fold in cocoa powder and flour.\n\n7. Layer - Spread slightly more than half the brownie batter into the skillet. Pour 1/2 cup salted caramel over the batter, spreading evenly but not quite to the edges. Spoon remaining batter over top, sealing in as much caramel as possible.\n\n8. Bake and serve - Bake for 30 minutes. Cool for 20 minutes, then drizzle with additional caramel and top with flaked sea salt.\n\n---\n[Original recipe](https://bromabakery.com/2015/05/salted-caramel-skillet-brownie-recipe.html)",
