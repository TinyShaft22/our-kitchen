**Prep Time:** 30 minutes
**Cook Time:** 30 minutes
**Total Time:** 1 hour

### Ingredients

**For the Caramel:**
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into tablespoons
- 1/2 cup heavy cream, room temperature
- 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt

### Instructions

**Make the Caramel:**
1. Heat sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally with a spatula to ensure even cooking. The sugar will become lumpy before melting into a brownish color.
2. Once fully melted and dark amber, remove from heat immediately and stir in butter. The mixture will bubble vigorously.
3. Stir butter and sugar together for 1-2 minutes until completely combined.
4. Pour in heavy cream and sea salt (use 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons based on preference). Stir until combined, then return to stove for about 30 seconds while stirring. Remove from heat and cool for 15 minutes.

**Make the Brownies:**
5. Preheat oven to 350°F. Generously grease a large skillet with butter.
6. Melt butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Stir in sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, and salt. Fold in cocoa powder and flour.
7. Spread slightly more than half the brownie batter into the skillet. Pour 1/2 cup salted caramel over the batter, spreading evenly but not quite to the edges. Spoon remaining batter over top, sealing in as much caramel as possible.
8. Bake for 30 minutes. Cool for 20 minutes, then drizzle with additional caramel and top with flaked sea salt.
